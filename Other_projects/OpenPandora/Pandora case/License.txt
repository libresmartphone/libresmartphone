I, Dave Cancilier,

still retain all rights and ownership an have rights to do anything with 
Pandora design/files as I wish, such as uploading to a website, selling the
files, using them for derivative works etc.

It is open for non commercial use, any company/persons using for monetary 
purposes or for resale must contact me first and possibly pay small 
royalties, or a one time fee on sales and/or use.

By accepting and redistributing these files/design you are agreeing to these 
terms.  If you do not agree, the files must be deleted/destroyed.


Regards,
Dave
