The Gerber and drill files contained in this package capture the state of the
FCDEV3B project as of 2016-02-02.  The design is still unfinished, i.e., we are
NOT going to order physical PCB fabrication with the present set of gerbers.
The issues which still need to be fixed are as follows:

* The footprints for through-hole connectors and jumpers have the wrong drill
  diameter;
* SH1 metal shieldcan footprint: the corners and T-shaped pieces which got lost
  in the PADS->Altium translation have been restored on the soldermask layer,
  but not on the solder paste layer yet;
* K301 and R317 refdes silk text overlaps some SMT pads;
* J302 and C306 have vias in the pads, but they are top-to-bottom vias, not
  microvias going just one layer deep.
* The RF clearing in the ground plane on layer 7 underneath C401 has the wrong
  shape;
* Some of the vias and TH component pin plated holes lack the copper on inner
  layers;
* TH component plated holes which connect to GND planes lack thermal reliefs on
  the inner layers.

There are other potential issues (may or may not be problems in need of fixing)
which are still being investigated.

Please also note that the board as viewed in the design tools from which the
gerbers are generated is flipped upside-down.  All components are placed on the
side which the design tools see as the bottom, and this side will actually be
the top during SMT assembly and in final usage.  The side which the design tools
see as the top will really be the bottom.  This unfortunate flip exists because
our board design has been derived from Openmoko's GTA02 motherboard, and the
latter had its Calypso GSM modem section (the critical part we are reusing) on
the side which was the bottom (or the back) in the GTA02 smartphone.
